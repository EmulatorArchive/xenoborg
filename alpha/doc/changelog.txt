10/28/11
- Added some preliminary audio and ac97 emulation code. Not enough to do much
  and is untested but will test asap. Going to use DirectSound for the time 
  being until I'm ready to use another more complex API.
- SIB.scale was not being handled at all.  Added a fix for that and now it 
  should work properly. Not thoroughly tested, but it appears to work for
  the comingSoon.xbe OpenXDK sample...
- comingSoon OpenXDK sample partially works. The screen clear to blue operation
  just creates blue vertical lines and the coming soon picture doesn't show yet.
  Crashes instead.
- The framebuffer pointer is allocated to be 4mb, not just the size of the 
  screen @ 32-bits.

10/27/11
- Fixed a nasty instruction decoding bug in emu_cpu.c, the instruction size
  was not being incremented under certain conditions involving the SIB byte
  and displacement bytes.  Might still cause problems in the future.

10/25/11
- Added support for kernel functions via HLE (temporary solution).
- Implemented the following kernel functions:
	* DbgPrint
	* KeTickCount
	* HalInitiateShutdown
	
10/22/11
- added support for new instructions:
	IN (all)
	OUT (all)

10/21/11
- Fixed a bug in mov (op 0xa0/0xa1) where displacement bytes weren't being used.
- xbdev.net's asm image sample now draws fine.
